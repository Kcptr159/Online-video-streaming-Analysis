# Online-video-streaming-Analysis
MovieNow is an imaginary online video streaming platform that allows users to rent and watch movies. This platform's database comprises several tables to manage its data.

For this project, I aim to answer several key questions:

1. How many unique customers and distinct countries are in the database?
2. What is the total count of movies and the number of distinct genres they fall into?
3. What is the total revenue generated by MovieNow?
4. What are the average, minimum, and maximum rental prices for movies on MovieNow?
5. How does the average rental price by genre compare to the overall average of $2.21?
6. Does the rental price impact how frequently movies are rented?
7. Does the movie rating affect its rental frequency?
8. What are the average, minimum, and maximum ratings for all movies?
9. Which movie(s) have a rating of 1?
10. Which movies have a perfect rating of 10?
11. Can we identify the top 10 movies with the highest number of rentals and their average ratings?
12. Do movies with a rating of 10 tend to have more rentals?
13. Who are the customers of MovieNow, and where do they originate from?
14. If MovieNow wants to reward its highest paying customer, who would that customer be, and which country do they reside in?
15. Which country contributes the most revenue to MovieNow?
16. Which movie genre generates the highest revenue?
